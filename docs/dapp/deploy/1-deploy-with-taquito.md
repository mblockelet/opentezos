The first step to creating a Dapp is to deploy a smart contract on the Tezos network, whether for testing or real-life use. There are several ways to do this, such as using the Tezos CLI.

However, during development, the smart contracts and the associated storage are likely to change: new field, field removal, structure change. For each change, a new deployment must be done.

Thus, the way that the contract is deployed will change accordingly, especially the initial storage. A minimal change in the storage definition can make the next deployments tiresome when using the Tezos CLI, especially if changes are made several times.
