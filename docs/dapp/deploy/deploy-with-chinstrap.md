*Chinstrap*, developed by [ant4g0nist](https://twitter.com/ant4g0nist), uses python scripts to perform smart contract deployments and makes deployments easier and faster.


*Chinstrap* makes developers' lives easier by providing support for multiple contract compilations, tests, and origination on public and private Tezos networks. *Chinstrap* can compile and deploy LIGO or SmartPy contracts on the Tezos network with a single command.

*Chinstrap* received grants from Tezos Foundation. :confetti_ball::confetti_ball:

3 directories, 5 files
```

* **contracts**: the folder containing all the LIGO/SmartPy smart contracts that *Chinstrap* has to compile.
* **originations**: the folder containing the *Chinstrap* origination/deployment scripts for the deployment of the contracts.
* **test**: the folder containing Javascript tests
* **chinstrap-config.yaml**: the configuration file which defines networks and accounts to be used for the deployment.


## Configuring *Chinstrap*

*Chinstrap* configuration file is a yaml file, that tells chinstrap, which account and network to use for origination, which compiler to use for compilation and testing.

A minimal configuration file looks like this:

```
chinstrap:
  network:
    development:
      host: http://localhost:12345
      accounts:
        - privateKeyFile: ./.secret
  compiler:
    lang: smartpy
    test: smartpy
```

The above configuration file tells *Chinstrap* that we are building contracts using SmartPy, and we are writing tests in SmartPy. It also specifies `development` as the network to use and specifies the privateKeyFile to use to originate.

### Configuring *Chinstrap* compiler
Supported options for `lang`:
- *smartpy*
- *cameligo*
- *pascaligo*
- *reasonligo*
- *jsligo*

Supported options for `test`:
- *smartpy*
- *pytest*
- *smartpy*
- *cameligo*
- *pascaligo*
- *reasonligo*
- *jsligo*

### Configuring *Chinstrap* network

The network configuration in *Chinstrap* is added under the `network` option. Some networks are already defined: _hangzhounet_, _ithacanet_, _mainnet_, and _development_. However, as the Tezos protocol constantly evolving, new networks will have to be added to the configuration.

Each network requires:
* **host**: An RPC node ([https://tezostaquito.io/docs/rpc_nodes/](https://tezostaquito.io/docs/rpc_nodes/)) or a local node (as shown in the development network).
* **accounts**: A lsit of files that contains private key of accounts to be used for origination. First account from the list is used for originations.

```‚ûú cat chinstrap-config.yml 
chinstrap:
# Networks define how Chinstrap connect to Tezos.
  network:
    development:
      host: http://localhost:20000

      # You need to configure accounts with private key,
      # to sign your transactions before they're sent to a remote public node
      accounts:
        - privateKeyFile: ./.secret

    # hangzhounet:
    #   host: https://hangzhounet.smartpy.io:443
    #   accounts:
    #     - privateKeyFile: ./.secret

    # ithacanet:
    #   host: https://ithacanet.smartpy.io:443
    #   accounts:
    #     - privateKeyFile: ./.secret

    # mainnet:
    #   host: https://mainnet.smartpy.io:443
    #   accounts:
    #     - privateKeyFile: ./.secret

  compiler:
    # Compiler configuration
    # lang: smartpy, cameligo, pascaligo, reasonligo, jsligo
    lang: smartpy

    # test: smartpy, pytest, smartpy, cameligo, pascaligo, reasonligo, jsligo
    test: smartpy
```

## Compiling smart contracts with *Chinstrap*

*Chinstrap* is mainly used for smart contract compilation, originations and testing. 


```
‚ûú chinstrap compile -h

      _     _           _
  ___| |__ (_)_ __  ___| |_ _ __ __ _ _ __
 / __| '_ \| | '_ \/ __| __| '__/ _` | '_ \

                                     |_|

üêß Chinstrap - a cute framework for developing Tezos Smart Contracts!
usage: chinstrap compile [-h] [-c CONTRACT] [-l] [-r] [-w] [-e ENTRYPOINT]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -c CONTRACT, --contract CONTRACT
                        Contract to compile. If not specified, all the contracts are compiled
  -l, --local           Use compiler from host machine. If not specified, Docker image is used
  -r, --werror          Treat Ligo compiler warnings as errors
  -w, --warning         Display Ligo compiler warnings
  -e ENTRYPOINT, --entrypoint ENTRYPOINT
                        Entrypoint to use when compiling Ligo contracts. Default entrypoint is main
```

To compile the contracts inside `contracts` folder, just run:

```
‚ûú chinstrap compile 

      _     _           _
  ___| |__ (_)_ __  ___| |_ _ __ __ _ _ __
 / __| '_ \| | '_ \/ __| __| '__/ _` | '_ \

 \___|_| |_|_|_| |_|___/\__|_|  \__,_| .__/
                                     |_|

üêß Chinstrap - a cute framework for developing Tezos Smart Contracts!
‚úî SampleContract.py compilation successful!
```

*Chinstrap* picks up the contracts based on the `lang` configured in `chinstrap-config.yml` and compiles with specific compiler. Compiled contracts can be found in `build/contracts/` folder. 

:::info
Chinstrap considers each file inside `contracts` folder as an independent smart contract. Thus, if a smart contract is split into several LIGO files, *Chinstrap* will try to compile each file as a separate smart contract, resulting sometimes in a failed compilation. 

But, *Chinstrap* will manage to compile the right contract using LIGO compiler.
:::


## Sandbox
*Chinstrap* provides a *sandbox* sub-command to manage a local development node with flextesa sandbox. This enables development and testing smart contracts on test network, before we proceed with _mainnet_.

```
‚ûú chinstrap sandbox -h

      _     _           _

## Originating smart contracts with *Chinstrap*

At this point, the smart contracts are compiled and ready to be originated. We are ready to originate or deploy our smart contracts on to the configured network. We will make use of Flextesa sandbox as a local node, to test our originations.

### Preparing origination scripts

Originating a contract needs origination script. Origination script usually updates the storage structure or initial data and the smart contract code. These scripts are located in the *orignations* directory. This works almost the same as *Truffle*.

Each origination is a _Python_ file, defining the deployment tasks, It executes Python code. Each origination starts with a number, followed by a title. *Chinstrap* will run the migrations in an ascending order.

An origination script defines:
* the initial storage of the smart contract(s)
* the contract deployment steps: the order of deployment of smart contracts, networks, accounts

These origination scripts are used the same way whether you deploy your smart contract for the first time, or you update a new version of a smart contract.

In any origination script, the first step is to import `getContract` function from `chinstrap.originations` module.

```
from chinstrap.originations import getContract
```

Next, we define a function called `deploy` that takes three arguments: 
- chinstrapState
- network
- accounts

```
def deploy(chinstrapState, network, accounts):
```

Now, inside the `deploy` funtion, we have to specify which smart contract is to be originated.

```
contract = getContract("SampleContract")
```

We define the storage as a json, and encode it as contract storage using `contract.storage.encode` function.

```
initial_storage = contract.storage.encode(
        {"counter": 0, "owner": accounts[0].key.public_key_hash()}
    )
```

Finally, we return `initial_storage`, `contract` from the function.

```
return initial_storage, contract
```

Here is a origination script example, defining a storage with essential types:

```
from chinstrap.originations import getContract

def deploy(chinstrapState, network, accounts):
    contract = getContract("SampleContract")
    initial_storage = contract.storage.encode(
        {"counter": 0, "owner": accounts[0].key.public_key_hash()}
    )
    return initial_storage, contract
```

### Originating

Before proceeding with originations, we have to configure accounts for originating. We can use any of the accounts generated by `chinstrap sandbox` and configure the accounts inside `chinstrap-config.yml`. We use these accounts ONLY on `development` network.

```
‚ûú cat .secret 
edsk3AiSAERPfe6yqS7Q4YAxBQ5L1NLUao2H9sP34x7u1tEkXB5bwX
```

Configuration file:

```
chinstrap:
  network:
    development:
      host: http://localhost:12345
      accounts:
        - privateKeyFile: ./.secret

  compiler:
    lang: smartpy
    test: smartpy
```

Finally we are ready to originate to development network. *Chinstrap* provides `originate* sub-command to originate contracts.

```
‚ûú chinstrap originate -h

  -r, --reset           Run all originations from the beginning, instead of running from the last
                        completed migration
  -c CONTRACT, --contract CONTRACT
                        Contract to compile. If not specified, all the contracts are compiled
  -l, --local           Use compiler from host machine. If not specified, Docker image is used
  -s, --show            Show addresses of originations
  -e ENTRYPOINT, --entrypoint ENTRYPOINT
                        Entrypoint to use when compiling Ligo contracts. Default entrypoint is main
  -f, --force           Force originate all originations. Be careful, this will re-originate all the
                        contracts even if they are already deployed.

```

To originate all the origination scripts, we jsut run:
```
‚ûú chinstrap originate -n development

:::info
On origination, Chinstrap calculates and keeps track of the sha256 hash of the compiled contracts. This helps in preventing duplicate originations. If you want to re-originate the same contract, you can force chinstrap to do so using the -f` or --force flag.
:::

### Testing

Please find documentation related to testing on [Chinstrap](https://chinstrap.io/docs/testing)

# Conclusion

The first step in developing a Dapp is to deploy the smart contracts. _Chinstrap_ takes LIGO/SmartPy code and deploys it onto any public or private network. Each origination needs an initial storage that is compliant with the storage type of Michelson code.

Thanks to its easy configuration and readable origination files, _Chinstrap_ is an essential tool throughout the development and deployment of a Dapp.
